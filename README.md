# Goal
In this, I completed the Hello World Brightspot tutorial.
The main goal was to use this CMS to create an article post resembling something like [this](https://www.cnet.com/news/ready-player-one-mines-the-80s-but-doesnt-dig-deep/).

# Issues
* The reloader was not working. Any changes I made, were not immediate and I had to restart the server after each change.
* I was unable to add comments under my article




# Brightspot Tutorials

## Repository Overview

This repository contains several tutorial projects illustrating various aspects of the Brightspot platform. 

## Directories

* **init** - This directory contains a bare-bones project with just enough to start the Hello World tutorial found at http://docs.brightspot.com/cms/developers-guide/tutorials/article-index.html.

* **hello-world** - This directory contains the results of the Hello World tutorial. Readers can compare their results from the Hello World tutorial with this one.
